Absolutely! A README is essential for providing information about your project, how to set it up, and any other relevant details. Here's a simple example README for your machine learning project:

```markdown
# Iris Classifier

This is a simple machine learning project that uses the Iris dataset to train a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier and evaluate its accuracy on a test set.

## Prerequisites

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Pip (to install dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd iris-classifier
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the script to train the classifier and print the accuracy:

```bash
python iris_classifier.py
```

The script will load the Iris dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier, and output the accuracy of the model.
